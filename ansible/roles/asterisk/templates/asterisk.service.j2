# access to the asterisk command-line without logging it. on the other
# hand, it allows anyone with physical access to the console full access
# to Asterisk. To enable this console, unrem the following lines and add
# '-c' to the ExecStart line above:
#TTYPath=/dev/tty9
#StandardInput=tty
#StandardOutput=tty
#StandardError=tty
